# Glasgow Workshop on Causal Panel Methods

Welcome to the materials for the **Glasgow Workshop on Causal Panel Methods**, a weeklong intensive course (9:00–16:00 daily) focused on advanced techniques for estimating causal effects in panel data.

---

## 📅 About the Workshop

This workshop introduces and explores some of the most important modern methods in causal inference for panel data, including:

- Difference-in-Differences (DiD)
- Synthetic Control Methods (SCM)
- Event studies and dynamic treatment effects
- Aggregation, weighting, and parallel trends diagnostics
- Recent innovations like CS, SA, DCDH, Honest DiD, and DDDiD

The goal is not to be exhaustive but rather to bring participants from **beginner to competent** over the course of the week.

## 📁 Structure

This repository contains:

- `/slides/` – Lecture slides for each day  
- `/code/` – Hands-on Stata and R code  
- `/data/` – Sample datasets used during exercises  
- `README.md` – This file  
- (Optional) `/references/` – Additional readings and papers

---

## 👩‍💻 Who Is This For?

Economists, data scientists, policy analysts, and researchers working with longitudinal or panel data who want to:

- Understand when and how DiD assumptions break down
- Learn how modern tools address those problems
- Practice implementing these methods in real code

---

## 🛠 Tools

We’ll primarily use:
- **Stata** (`csdid`, `drdid`, `eventstudyinteract`)
- **R** (`did`, `fixest`, `synth`, `honestdid`)

Participants should be comfortable with basic regression and panel data structures but no prior experience with DiD is assumed.
